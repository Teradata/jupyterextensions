Each party will bear its own attorney's fees and costs related to the arbitration. The obligations to negotiate, mediate and arbitrate shall not apply to claims for misuse or infringement of a party’s intellectual property rights.  Any claim or action must be brought within two years after the claimant knows or should have known of the claim.  New York law will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitrability of claims under this Section.

You will not assign this Agreement or your rights, nor will you delegate your obligations under this Agreement.  Failure by either party to enforce any term or condition of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other term or condition.
